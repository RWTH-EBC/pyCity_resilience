      abstract     = {Cities, as large energy consumers, offer great potential
                      for greenhouse gas emission reduction. Urban energy system
                      planning is important to identify low-emission,
                      cost-efficient solutions to contribute to global emission
                      reduction aims. However, the planning process is challenging
                      due to uncertainty. Conventional approaches to deal with
                      uncertainty mainly use robust optimization or stochastic
                      programming, which are computationally intensive on urban
                      scale and might not support the identification of energy
                      systems with reduced sensitivity to uncertainty. The subject
                      of this thesis is to identify urban energy systems, which
                      are less sensitive to uncertainty. An optimization framework
                      is developed, which combines a genetic algorithm for
                      optimized energy system placement with an economic and
                      ecological uncertainty calculator. Demand-related,
                      technical, and economic uncertainties are taken into
                      account. The effect of different risk attitudes, from risk
                      neutral to high risk-aversity, is analyzed. Results show
                      that a reduction of economic and ecological uncertainty is
                      possible but at the drawback of worse mean cost and emission
                      values. The uncertainty reduction within the given case
                      study is achieved by increasing the nominal power of the
                      combined heat and power (CHP) units as well as the capacity
                      of the thermal storage systems and decreasing photovoltaic
                      (PV) area sizes. Boiler-PV combinations define
                      cost-efficient results. CHP usage with local heating
                      networks generates further emission reduction. Reference
                      optimizations without uncertainty and the optimization with
                      uncertainty lead to comparable results. However, not all
                      reference optimization results perform well under
                      uncertainty. While many small-scale CHP configurations have
                      a pareto-optimal behavior for the reference scenario, they
                      lead to suboptimal performance under uncertainty. The
                      presented framework enables the identification of energy
                      systems, which perform well under uncertainty. Moreover, it
                      enables a reduction of economic and ecological uncertainty
                      for different risk-attitudes. However, the optimization
                      process turns out to be computationally intensive, too.
                      Thus, a reference optimization without uncertainty should be
                      preferred for applications with low availability of
                      computational resources. Still, the presented method
                      provides deeper insights into the economic and ecological
                      uncertainty of urban energy systems.},
